## Stack and Queue Implementations

In the `stack_queue` directory, you can find Python implementations of stack and queue data structures. These implementations include basic operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue, along with any additional functionalities.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The `machine_learning` directory contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Below are descriptions of each algorithm:

- **Asteric**: This algorithm implements the Asteric algorithm for feature selection in machine learning.
- **LIterativeDFS**: This algorithm implements the LIterativeDFS algorithm for tree traversal.
- **DLC_UDC**: Implementation of DLC_UDC algorithm for data clustering.
- **MinMaxAlgorithm**: This algorithm implements the MinMax algorithm for normalization of data.
- **Naive Bayes**: Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification based on Bayes' theorem.
- **AlphaBeta Pruning**: Implementation of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for optimizing the minimax algorithm in game theory.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implementation of the K-Means algorithm for data clustering.
- **Neural Networks**: Implementation of various neural network architectures for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.

Each algorithm is implemented with clear comments and explanations to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Stock Prediction Project

The `stock_prediction` directory contains a Python project for stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) where users can select a stock, plot its forecasted prices, and see the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values for the forecasts.
